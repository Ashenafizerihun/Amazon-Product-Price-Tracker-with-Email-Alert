This project focused on automating the price monitoring process for a single product on Amazon, url: https://www.amazon.com/Gloria-Vanderbilt-Amanda-Average-Madison/dp/B079GTKB7B/
Using Python's powerful libraries, I developed a script to:
1. Continuously scrape the product's price at regular intervals.
2. Append the price data to a CSV file for historical tracking and analysis.
3. Send an email alert to the user when the product's price drops below the set target price, enabling timely purchase decisions.
